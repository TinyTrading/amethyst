Hello, and welcome to **Tiny Trading**! I'm excited to embark on this journey with you, where we explore the fascinating world of trading. This is a continuous adventure where I aim to build a robust and profitable trading system starting with $5,000 USD, and I'd love for you to be a part of it. Join me on my live streams [on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/tinytrading)!

## What is Tiny Trading?
**Tiny Trading** is my attempt at creating a community-driven effort to learn the intricacies of the trading realm. We'll cover everything from low-level programming to the mathematics of potential strategies and everything in between. The main goal of this project is educational: to foster a community where we can learn together from and leverage our collective knowledge.

This is a long-term project. As time passes and the market continues to evolve, so will our strategies and systems. We will (hopefully) make money and learn as much as possible about trading along the way.

## About me
My name is Luis Victoria. I finished my undergrad at the end of 2022 and have since been working as a software engineer. I currently live in New York City ðŸ—½. While I do work in the financial industry, I still have much to learn. This project is my way of changing that, even if it's just a little bit.

Let's build something great together!
